                <p>Banksia canei, the mountain banksia, is a shrub of the subalpine areas of Australia's Great Dividing Range, between Melbourne and Canberra. First described in 1967, it superficially resembles B. marginata, but is more closely related to another subalpine species, B. saxicola. Although no subspecies are recognised, four geographically isolated populations have been described. There is significant variation in the shape of the leaves between populations. B. canei is generally encountered as a shrub that grows up to 3 m (10 ft) high, with many branches and narrow leaves, and with yellow inflorescences (flower spikes) from late summer to early winter. Old flowers fall off the spikes, and up to 150 seed-bearing follicles develop, which mostly remain closed until burnt in a bushfire. Birds such as the yellow-tufted honeyeater and various insects forage among the flower spikes. B. canei is frost tolerant in cultivation, but copes less well with aridity or humidity, and is often short-lived in gardens. (Full article...)</p>

                <p>	
                    Quo Vadis is a 1913 Italian silent film directed by Enrico Guazzoni for Cines, based on a novel of the same name by Henryk Sienkiewicz. It was one of the first blockbusters in the history of cinema, with five thousand extras, lavish sets, and a lengthy running time of two hours. Set during the latter years of the reign of the Roman emperor Nero, the film depicts his persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire in the mid–1st century. This poster, produced for the American film producer George Kleine to advertise Quo Vadis, depicts the execution of Lygia, a young Christian woman, in the Circus of Nero in Rome: she is tied to the back of a bull, in imitation of the mythological princess Europa.</p>
